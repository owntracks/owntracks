While there are many smartphone apps available which can do that, we think OwnTracks is special.\n\n\n\n\nWhether you want your young child to know where you currently are, or you want to keep track of where you spent your last vacation, or you and a group of friends want to see each other on a map, OwnTracks does that. It consists of an app which runs on your smart phone, and which periodically, publishes a small chunk of data which other OwnTracks users you authorize may see. The big deal here is \nwhich you authorize\n: we are extremely picky about \nthe security features of OwnTracks\n.\n\n\nFrom this point onwards, it gets a bit complicated, but we'll try and ease your way into the world of OwnTracks so you may enjoy it. If you are unsure of something, would like to chat to us or ask questions, join \nour community\n; please feel free to bring any questions or conversation relating to OwnTracks, its usage, or location awareness to that group.\n\n\nWe've made OwnTracks very easy to try out without you having to do very much: our \nPublic\n mode gets you running right away for demonstration purposes. In \nHTTP\n mode, the apps will publish to a HTTP endpoint of your chosing. And next to these two, the full power of OwnTracks is at your disposal if you want to personalize your setup.\n\n\nWe think the best way to get started using OwnTracks is to follow this guide, chapter by chapter, but you certainly may fast-forward or even skip sections you're familiar with. Pressing \nNext\n on each page will guide you (pun!) through the guide.\n\n\nWe'll now move on to explain \nwhat OwnTracks does and how it works\n.",

            "text": "What OwnTracks does\n\n\nThe OwnTracks app runs in the background on your Android or iOS device and waits for the smart phone to tell it that the device has moved, whereupon OwnTracks sends out a message with its current coordinates (and a few other things we'll discuss in a moment).\n\n\nWe'd like you to read this bit again:\n\n\n\n\nwaits for the smart phone to tell it that the device has moved\n\n\n\n\nIt is very important to understand that OwnTracks literally waits for the device's operating system to inform it of a movement; only then can OwnTracks react and do something. To make matters even more complicated\n1\n, OwnTracks on Android runs in the background, all the time, whereas on iOS it is \"killed off\" by the operating system and woken up every several hundred seconds, in which it gets a teeny tiny time slot to do its thing.\n\n\nThat's basically all OwnTracks does.\n\n\nMore\n\n\nThat last sentence isn't true. Strike it.\n\n\nOwnTracks does quite a bit more. It shows your location on a map. Wow: big deal, huh? Well, it shows your location and \nthat of your friends\n on a map. Ah: better. It can also detect when you enter or leave a particular region for which \nyou set a so-called waypoint\n. People use this, say, to control some aspect of their home-automation system. (Everybody left home? We can turn the lights off.)\n\n\nOwnTracks also has a pedometer, a.k.a. step counter (on iPhone 5S, 6) which you can query remotely. OwnTracks has support for \niBeacons\n, and it gives you neat notifications when one of your friends gets home so you can phone them over a land-line to plan a get-together.\n\n\nOwnTracks reports the device's battery level remotely so you can add that to your monitoring setup, if you have one. (No worries if you don't -- you probably don't need it then.)\n\n\nAnd finally, though for us this is \nvery\n important, OwnTracks does all this securely.\n\n\nHow OwnTracks works\n\n\nThe OwnTracks apps run on your smart phone (but we've already mentioned that at least once, haven't we?). When the device determines that it's \nmoved\n a significant distance\n1\n, it contacts a server via 3G or WiFi (hopefully one of those is available, but we queue messages many thousands on the app until connectivity can be established) and says \"\nhey, I'm here\n\", whereby \"\nhere\n\" is specified with a bit more precision. This server is either a HTTP Web server or an MQTT server. This last server is called a \nbroker\n and the contact is made with an open, lightweight, \nstandardized protocol called MQTT\n. (If you think that's bad it isn't: the protocol you use to surf the Web is called HTTP; does that sound much better?) So the smart phone sends your location (this operation is called \npublish\n in MQTT-speak) to the broker and goes back to sleep until it realizes you've again moved a significant distance whereupon the whole procedure starts anew. This broker is ideally something you provide, but we can help you out to start with by lending you the use of ours, free of charge for a while.\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using MQTT, you can configure the apps to use HTTP, whereupon they then speak HTTP to your server.\n\n\n\n\nAbove: the general architecture of OwnTracks\n\n\nThe broker receives the data, and then? Well, it can re-distribute it, at your wish. What this basically means is it can forward your location to a friend, \nto a program\n which stores your location in, say, a database, etc. There are plenty of things you can do, and we'll show you some of them later.\n\n\nThe important message here, and we can't repeat this often enough: OwnTracks is designed in such a way as that you can chose what you do with your data. It's \nyours\n.\n\n\nBasic setup\n\n\nOwnTracks used to be difficult to set up particularly because you had to provide the server (called a \nbroker\n, remember?) yourself, but we've gone to great lengths to make it easy for you to try before you'll want to take it upon yourself to do all the setup work.\n\n\nWe'll now cover the \nthree basic scenarios\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a relative amount, but you can tune it a bit.",

(Do remember however, that you cannot do this in \npublic mode\n.)\n\n\nYou know that OwnTracks \npublishes\n location information to an MQTT or HTTP endpoint. The data it publishes is transferred in a particular format called \nJSON\n, and \nthis is what it looks like\n.\n\n\nWhen you've got your endpoint set up, and OwnTracks configured to use it, you'll want to do something useful with the data, and the following sections introduce you to some of the existing clients you can utilize for doing that.\n\n\nmosquitto_sub\n\n\nmosquitto_sub\n is a very basic command-line client provided by the \nMosquitto project\n. However, it is brilliantly useful, and you can also use it for long-time collection of data by having it run in the background with \nstdout\n pointing to a file.\n\n\nIn it's most basic invocation, you have the program connect to your broker and subscribe to the topics you're interested in.\n\n\nmosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -v -t 'owntracks/#'\n\n\n\n\nmosquitto_sub\n and it's counterpart, \nmosquitto_pub\n for publishing to a broker, support a slew of options. It'll be worth your while to study their \nmanual page\n.\n\n\nRecorder\n\n\nWe recommend our very own \nOwnTracks Recorder\n because it's lightweight, relatively simple to set up, and because it offers a lot of features. It stores location data published by the apps by subscribing to an MQTT broker, and it enables you to access that data in a variety of formats. The best part is: it doesn't require a heavy external database of any kind.\n\n\n\n\nAnd the best is, you can configure the Recorder to also accept the HTTP POST requests from the apps, so it's the best companion for the OwnTracks apps in HTTP mode as well.\n\n\nRead \nmore about the Recorder\n.\n\n\no2s\n\n\nOne of the clients we provide as part of the Open Source OwnTracks project is called \no2s\n; the strange name stands for \nOwnTracks to Storage\n, and you can use this connected to your \nMQTT broker\n in \nPrivate mode\n, if you need a MySQL or PostgreSQL database. (We do recommend, however, that you use our \nRecorder\n (see above).)\n\n\nCorrectly configured (and it's not trivial), \no2s\n connects to your broker and subscribes to location messages and other \nOwnTracks payloads\n.

In its simplest form it can be configured with waypoints (for home/work etc) that generate events whenever your phone enters/leaves these regions. These are sent to your own personal \nMQTT broker\n where your home automation software can react accordingly. The beauty of OwnTracks is two-fold - it is simple, you can disable the standard location reporting so all you get is the waypoint event/leave events, which is all your smart home cares about. The second is that, in \nprivate mode\n, all your data is 'yours' and yours alone - there is no cloud service collecting, storing and potentially mining your data. \n\n\nRead more about \nopenHAB and OwnTracks\n.\n\n\nHome Assistant\n\n\nAnother home automation solution that can be used with OwnTracks is Home Assistant. Home Assistant allows you to track the location of people connected to your personal \nMQTT broker\n. It has a map to show their current location and can trigger automations based on entering and leaving zones. In order to use the internal broker of Home Assistant, the MQTT protocol level has to be set to 4. \n\n\nSee the \ndemo\n for an example of the map with OwnTracks devices or read more about how Home Assistant \nconnects to your private MQTT broker\n, how to \nenable OwnTracks support in Home Assistant\n and how to \nconfigure automations based on zones\n.\n\n\nRoll your own\n\n\nIf you feel really brave, you can \nwrite your own program\n which subscribes to OwnTracks data, but don't forget to tell us about it!\n\n\nRelated\n\n\nHere are some projects we know of which use and/or integrate OwnTracks and/or\nwhich are useful when using MQTT in general or OwnTracks in particular.\n\n\n\n\nMQTT Inspector for iOS\n, written by Christoph Krey, who also did our OwnTracks for iOS app. This is an indispensable utility for all things MQTT.\n\n\nthe thing system\n ( \ncode\n )\n\n\nA Clojure webapp that aims to manage information gathered from OwnTracks; \nclojure-mqttitude-backend\n\n\nAn \nOwnTracks flow\n by \nGiovanni @juzam Angoli\n for Node-RED which publishes messages to \npushover.net\n upon entering or leaving a geo-fence.\n\n\nMyMQTT\n is an app for Android which enables you to subscribe and publish to an MQTT broker.\n\n\nStefano Costa cooks Italian pasta \nusing OwnTracks\n.\n\n\nMatthew Bordignon made a small \nWeb page which uses Websockets to display the barometer reading\n published by OwnTracks for iOS.

            "text": "MQTT broker\n\n\nAn MQTT broker is a service to which MQTT clients connect. These clients publish\ndata to specific \ntopics\n and they can subscribe to one or more \ntopics\n to receive\nmessages. A \ntopic\n is like an \"address\" for a particular message. For example,\na topic for a device that publishes a temperature reading of your living room\nmay be \ntemperature/indoors/living\n, whereas a device which publishes weather\ndata could do so to \nweather/germany/frankfurt\n. In the particular case of OwnTracks, we\nuse a topic branch called \nowntracks/username/device\n, but you can override that\nname if you prefer to. The reason we've chosen that structure is to accomodate\nfriends and family on a single broker, taking into consideration that a particular\nuser might have more than one device.\n\n\nPrivate broker\n\n\nIdeally, you set up a private broker under your control. This sounds more difficult\nthan it actually is, and there are some very nice brokers you can use free of charge\non your own infrastructure. As an example, we've written up how to install\nMosquitto on a Raspberry Pi.\n\n\nRasPi\n\n\n\n\nThe hardest bit is installing an OS, say, \nRaspbian Wheezy\n, onto an SD card, but there are many tutorials on how to do that. (Here's an example \nusing Mac OS X\n.) A basic install will suffice, and after logging in with Raspbian's default username and password, we'll get started from there. Note that the current Raspbian Wheezy mosquitto package does NOT contain the \nmosquitto_passwd\n tool. If you want to use it, make sure you install the package from a mosquitto repo:\n\n\nRoger Light, \nMosquitto\n's creator has thankfully (!) set up a few \nMosquitto repositories\n we can use to obtain the latest and greatest version, so we'll do just that. We first perform the required steps to add and activate the repository. The last step in particular can take a few moments.\n\n\ncurl -O http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-repo.gpg.key\nsudo apt-key add mosquitto-repo.gpg.key\nrm mosquitto-repo.gpg.key\ncd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/\nsudo curl -O http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-$(awk -F\n[)(]+\n '/VERSION=/ {print $2}' /etc/os-release).list\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n\n\nNow we can go ahead and install \nMosquitto\n proper. There are three packages:\n\n\n\n\nmosquitto\n is the MQTT broker (i.e. server)\n\n\nmosquitto-clients\n are the command-line clients, which I recommend you install\n\n\nDon't install \npython-mosquitto\n; if you want to do programming with Python and MQTT, we \nshow you how to do so with the Paho Python module\n.\n\n\n\n\nsudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients\n\n\n\n\nRegrettably, as with most Debian packages, the broker is immediately started; stop it.\n\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/mosquitto stop\n\n\n\n\nThat concludes the installation of the \nMosquitto\n MQTT broker, and we'll now proceed to\nits configuration. This section is geared towards a configuration of \nMosquitto\n which will\nwork well with OwnTracks. In particular we want the following features enabled\nby default:\n\n\n\n\nConnections to the broker must be authenticated either against user/password or using client certificates.\n\n\nConnections to the broker shall also be \nTLS\n protected. This requires a (server-side) TLS certificate and key which will be configured automatically.\n\n\nACLs will restrict who may access what.\n\n\n\n\nTo create a \nmosquitto\n user database, use \nsudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd \nusername\n.\n\n\nYou will be prompted to enter a password. That will be the password required to connect to the server (with the username you chose).

It's hard stabbing around in the dark when a glance at a log file can give you valuable tips on what is actually happening.\n\n\nMosquitto typically logs via \nsyslog\n, and \nsyslog\n's configuration defines where the log messages are actually written to. Your \nsyslog\n may be called \nsyslog\n, \nrsyslog\n, \nsyslog-ng\n, or anything else for that matter. In case of doubt, check the files in \n/var/log\n; one of them \nought\n to have what you're looking for (e..g \nmessages\n, \nsyslog\n, \nlocalmessages\n, or even \ndebugmessages\n).\n\n\nMosquitto typically logs each connection request, a publish, a subscribe request, etc. (Read the \nmanpage for \nmosquitto.conf\n to learn how to configure logging.\n\n\nA successful publish of an OwnTracks location could look somewhat like this:\n\n\nmosquitto[1366]: Received PUBLISH from jane-5s-m-o (d0, q2, r1, m7, 'owntracks/jane/5s', ...

As an example, suppose Jane (username \njjolie\n) should be able to publish to her \nOwnTracks MQTT topics\n and Fred (username \nfred\n) should be allowed to see Jane's location, we could configure something like this:\n\n\nuser jjolie\ntopic owntracks/jjolie/#\n\nuser fred\ntopic read owntracks/jjolie/5s\ntopic owntracks/fred/nexus/#\n\n\n\n\nFirewall\n\n\nIf you want to run your \nPrivate\n broker it's possibly going to be at home under your desk (or is it in your small office?). Be that as it may, how does an OwnTracks app reach (network-wise) that broker?  Chances are you have some form of router which connects the local network in your home to the Internet.\n\n\nOwnTracks runs on the device which is in your pocket or your purse, or wherever you placed it, and it must be able to connect to your MQTT broker, but it cannot: your router hopefully has a firewall configured on it which will allow outgoing (from your home outwards) connections, but it is sure to not allow incoming connections. We must change that, at least for MQTT, and we're going to assume you've configured TLS, i.e. your broker is (also) listening on TCP port 8883\n\n\nWhat you need to do to get this working is to reconfigure your router to allow incoming TCP traffic on port 8883 and to hand that off to the TCP/IP address of your MQTT broker. The exact details on how to do that vary from vendor to vendor, but a close look at the documentation of your router should show you how to do that.\n\n\nWhat is also likely, or at least possible, is that your home doesn't have a fixed TCP/IP address, but one which changes periodically. The OwnTracks apps won't be able to find your home then, will they? If you keep \"moving\" (i.e changing addresses).\n\n\nA service which is typically (if maybe incorrectly) called dynamic DNS comes to the rescue. These services allow you to configure a DNS name (e.g. \nfreds-router.example.org\n) which points to the changing IP address of your router.\n\n\nOnce you've completed those steps, configure the OwnTracks apps to use the shiny new DNS name and TCP port number (8883) and you should be all set.\n\n\nOwnTracks\n\n\nSo, you've configured your broker and you are familiar with the \nmosquitto\n command-line\nclients, so now it's time to see if you can \nget OwnTracks to speak to your broker\n.",

A basic install will suffice, and after logging in with Raspbian's default username and password, we'll get started from there. Note that the current Raspbian Wheezy mosquitto package does NOT contain the  mosquitto_passwd  tool. If you want to use it, make sure you install the package from a mosquitto repo:  Roger Light,  Mosquitto 's creator has thankfully (!) set up a few  Mosquitto repositories  we can use to obtain the latest and greatest version, so we'll do just that. We first perform the required steps to add and activate the repository. The last step in particular can take a few moments.  curl -O http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-repo.gpg.key\nsudo apt-key add mosquitto-repo.gpg.key\nrm mosquitto-repo.gpg.key\ncd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/\nsudo curl -O http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-$(awk -F [)(]+  '/VERSION=/ {print $2}' /etc/os-release).list\nsudo apt-get update  Now we can go ahead and install  Mosquitto  proper.

This section is geared towards a configuration of  Mosquitto  which will\nwork well with OwnTracks. In particular we want the following features enabled\nby default:   Connections to the broker must be authenticated either against user/password or using client certificates.  Connections to the broker shall also be  TLS  protected. This requires a (server-side) TLS certificate and key which will be configured automatically.  ACLs will restrict who may access what.   To create a  mosquitto  user database, use  sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd  username .  You will be prompted to enter a password. That will be the password required to connect to the server (with the username you chose). If you want to add more users, repeat the command without  -c  as that will create (i.e. overwrite) the passwd file.\nAdd a config line  password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd  to  /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf .

In this example, we'll assume the following:\n\n\n\n\nYour broker will initiate a connection to Jane's broker\n\n\nYou'll be using \nTLS\n to protect credentials and data in transit\n\n\nJane has given you (e.g. via e-mail) a copy of her TLS CA certificate\n\n\nJane has set up an ACL on her \nMosquitto\n broker to ensure you have access only to her OwnTracks location data and nothing else.\n\n\nJane has a username and password for your broker to use when connecting to her broker, and she's given you both.\n\n\nJane has a device called \nnexus7\n and she publishes location updates to \nher\n broker at \nowntracks/jane/nexus7\n.\n\n\nYou have an iPhone and want to share your location data with Jane. You publish (on your broker) to \nowntracks/john/iphone\n.\n\n\n\n\nHere's what you configure \non your broker\n's \nmosquitto.conf\n:\n\n\n# Bridge to Jane\nconnection br-me-to-jane\nbridge_cafile /etc/mosquitto/jane/JANE-OwnTracks-ca.crt\nbridge_insecure false\naddress jane.example.org:8883\ncleansession false\nclientid br-john-jane\nstart_type automatic\nusername john\npassword s3cr1t\nnotifications false\ntry_private true\ntopic nexus7 in 2 owntracks/jane/ owntracks/jane/\ntopic iphone out 2 owntracks/john/ owntracks/john/\n\n\n\n\nThese last two lines define which topic branches will be published (\nout\n) and\nwhich will be subscribed to (\nin\n) from the point of view of your broker. There\nare a lot of things you can tweak in this configuration, but this is should get\nyou started.\n\n\nPublishes\n\n\nWhen your device publishes location data to your broker, it will publish the single topic \nowntracks/john/iphone\n to Jane's broker. Conversely, as your broker is now subscribed to Jane's at \nowntracks/jane/nexus7\n, it will receive Jane's location data and re-publish that to your connected device.\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nOwnTracks uses more than just a single topic per user \nas documented\n. This means we must add more \ntopic\n statements to our broker (and Jane to her broker) if we additionally want to support transition events (e.g. when did Jane leave home?) and outgoing commands (e.g. tell Jane's device to report its location \nnow\n).\n\n\nAssuming Jane allows this (by configuring appropriate ACLs on her broker), we add one or more of the following. The first line we already had: it bridges Jane's location publishes \nin\n to our broker. The second line is new: it bridges Jane's \nnexus7\n events into our broker.\n\n\ntopic nexus7 in 2 owntracks/jane/ owntracks/jane/\ntopic event in 2 owntracks/jane/nexus7/ owntracks/jane/nexus7/\n\n\n\n\nCMD\n\n\nTapping on OwnTrack's \nrequest location update\n publishes a \ncmd\n to the destination device, so we bridge that topic \nout\n towards Jane's broker:\n\n\ntopic cmd out 2 owntracks/jane/nexus7/ owntracks/jane/nexus7/\n\n\n\n\nMQTTitude\n\n\nLet's assume for the moment that you're running a broker with a number of connected OwnTracks clients, some of which are still publishing to the \"old\" topic branch at `mqttitude/', but you want to \"assimilate\" these clients into your environment without having to force them to rename the topic to which they publish. You can easily do that in Mosquitto, by adding the following line to your bridge configuration:\n\n\ntopic # in 2 owntracks/ mqttitude/\n\n\n\n\nWhat this does is: your bridge subscribes to the \nremote\n topic \nmqttitude/#\n and all received messages will be republished at \nowntracks/\n on \nyour\n broker (note the \nin\n direction). \n\n\nNeat, eh? \n\n\nConsult the manual page for\n\nmosquitto.conf\n for more\ndetails.",

Jane has a username and password for your broker to use when connecting to her broker, and she's given you both.  Jane has a device called  nexus7  and she publishes location updates to  her  broker at  owntracks/jane/nexus7 .  You have an iPhone and want to share your location data with Jane.

Tapping on\nthe entry switches back to map centered on friend's last location.\n\n\nThe first time you launch the app you'll also be asked whether it may access your\ncontacts data, which you should allow.

The inner area of the circle either shows a picture of yourself / your friend or the Tracker ID (tid) which is usually 2 characters and defaults to the last two characters of the publish topic.\n\n\nA red, yellow rimmed tachometer indicating the velocity (speed) at the reported location starts at at the 6 o'clock position and works clockwise. It uses a logarithmic scale to show slow speeds\nas good as high speeds. The 9 o'clock position indicates a speed of 30 km/h, the 12 o'clock posistion a speed of 100 km/h. 3 o'clock means 180 km/h.\n\n\nA small blue, yellow rimmed semicircle at the perimeter indicates the course over ground (direction of movement)  with the 12 o'clock position meaning North.\n\n\nIf your iOS addressbook has an entry for, say, Jane Jolie, and Jane has an image associated with her addressbook entry, OwnTracks will show Jane's image on the map and on the \nFriends\n list, as soon as a location update for Jane is seen by the app.\n\n\nIn order to associate an MQTT topic with our friend (Jane, in this case), edit your addressbook entry on iOS for Jane and do either of the following:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new relationship (like 'Spouse') called \nOwnTracks\n (case insensitive), and add your friend's topic name to that (e.g. \nowntracks/jane/loc\n)\n\n\n\n\nThe addressbook API might need a while to be refreshed, but you may be able to speed that up by swiping the Friends list downward until the activity indicator appears, then let go).\n\n\nor...\n\n\nTap the Bookmark Button in the Navigation Bar on the Location screen. Select an entry from your Address Book.\nThe entry will be marked with a relationship to the current friend's topic name.\n\n\nRegion Monitoring and Waypoints\n\n\nFor all manually published locations, a description, a region radius and a share flag can be edited.\n\n\nSetting the description of a location helps you to remember places.\n\n\nIf a description is entered and the share flag set, the location is published to the MQTT broker as a \nwaypoint\n once.\n\n\nIf the description is non-empty and a radius \n 0 (meters) is set, the app starts monitoring the circular region around the coordinate. A region may be 'waypoint'.\nThe regions are shown on the map as blue-ish circles. If the device is within a region, the corresponding circle turns red-ish.\n\n\nIf the description is non-empty and includes a value UUID for an iBeacon, the app starts monitoring the iBeacon region. e.g. 'myBeacons:CA271EAE-5FA8-4E80-8F08-2A302A95A959'\nmonitors any iBeacon identified with UUID = CA..., with major and minor numbers irrelevant.\n\n\nEverytime the devices enters or leaves a monitored region, an additional location message is published to the MQTT broker.\n\n\nUse cases:\n\n Define a \nhome\n region to insure that the device publishes a new location when coming home or leaving home even if you do not move more than 500m.\n\n Share your favorite places with your friends (\"Best Sushi in Town\").\n\n Keep a private note (\"Parked Car here\").\n\n Use iBeacons to accurately report enter/leave events for your home\n* Use iBeacons to publish enter/leave events for individual rooms/floors in your home\n\n\nSee also \nWaypoints\n.\n\n\nRegion monitoring (a.k.a. Geo Fences)\n\n\nIf the waypoint description is non-empty and a radius \n 0 (meters) is set, the\napp starts monitoring the circular region around the specified coordinates. \nRegions are shown on the map as blue-ish circles. If the\ndevice is within a region, the corresponding circle turns red-ish. Every time\nthe devices enters or leaves a monitored region, an additional location message\nis published to the MQTT broker, specifying whether the device is entering or leaving\nsaid region.\n\n\nFor example, you can define a home region to ensure that the device publishes a\nnew location when coming home or leaving home even if you do not move more than\n500m. Share your favorite places with your friends (\"Best Sushi in Town\"). Keep\na private note (\"Parked Car here\").\n\n\nRegion Monitoring with iBeacons\n\n\nRather than setting the radius, you may add your iBeacon's UUID and optionally major and minor numbers\nto the description to start region monitoring using iBeacons.\n\n\ne.g.\n* 'myBeacon:CA271EAE-5FA8-4E80-8F08-2A302A95A959:0001:CAFE'\nreports region with description 'myBeacon' when the iBeacon identified with UUID = CA..., major = 0001 and minor = CAFE is in proximity\n\n\n\n\n'myBeacons:CA271EAE-5FA8-4E80-8F08-2A302A95A959'\nreports region with description 'myBeacons' when any iBeacon identified with UUID = CA..., with major and minor numbers irrelevant is in proximity\n\n\n\n\nRemote configuration\n\n\nYou can help your friends customize their copy of OwnTracks with \nremote configuration\n.\n\n\nWhy do location publishes sometimes seem to cease to work?\n\n\nHere's what happens:\n\n\nIf the app goes into Background, the connection is disconnected because the app\ncannot maintain the TCP connection in background.\n\n\nIf you bring the app back into foreground, the app will re-connect.\n\n\nWhen a location change is recorded (no matter if manual, significant, move or\nregion mode), a message is prepared and an attempt to connect to the broker is\nstarted. If there is an error, connect will be retried after 2, 4, 8, ..., 64,\n64, .... seconds until it succeeds.\n\n\nBUT...\n\n\nIf the application is in background or is sent to the background, retries are\nrestarted eventually - depending on iOS' background execution model about every 10 minutes.\n\n\nWith automatic modes switched off, even when bringing the app to foreground, no\nnew location updates are generated.\n\n\nToday Widget / Apple Watch\n\n\nThere is a \"today Widget\" you can enable in OwnTracks for iOS which will show friends and their distances from you.  All friends which have a name are shown on the Today Widget or on the Apple Watch.\n\n\n\n\nA name is assigned either by linking a friend to an address book entry (remember we have two different ways to do that: One modifies the address book, the other one just keeps a pointer to the address book record in OwnTracks).\n\n\nor by sending a \ncard\n.",

The inner area of the circle either shows a picture of yourself / your friend or the Tracker ID (tid) which is usually 2 characters and defaults to the last two characters of the publish topic.  A red, yellow rimmed tachometer indicating the velocity (speed) at the reported location starts at at the 6 o'clock position and works clockwise. It uses a logarithmic scale to show slow speeds\nas good as high speeds. The 9 o'clock position indicates a speed of 30 km/h, the 12 o'clock posistion a speed of 100 km/h. 3 o'clock means 180 km/h.  A small blue, yellow rimmed semicircle at the perimeter indicates the course over ground (direction of movement)  with the 12 o'clock position meaning North.  If your iOS addressbook has an entry for, say, Jane Jolie, and Jane has an image associated with her addressbook entry, OwnTracks will show Jane's image on the map and on the  Friends  list, as soon as a location update for Jane is seen by the app.  In order to associate an MQTT topic with our friend (Jane, in this case), edit your addressbook entry on iOS for Jane and do either of the following:   Create a new relationship (like 'Spouse') called  OwnTracks  (case insensitive), and add your friend's topic name to that (e.g.  owntracks/jane/loc )   The addressbook API might need a while to be refreshed, but you may be able to speed that up by swiping the Friends list downward until the activity indicator appears, then let go).  or...  Tap the Bookmark Button in the Navigation Bar on the Location screen. Select an entry from your Address Book.\nThe entry will be marked with a relationship to the current friend's topic name.  Region Monitoring and Waypoints  For all manually published locations, a description, a region radius and a share flag can be edited.  Setting the description of a location helps you to remember places.  If a description is entered and the share flag set, the location is published to the MQTT broker as a  waypoint  once.  If the description is non-empty and a radius   0 (meters) is set, the app starts monitoring the circular region around the coordinate. A region may be 'waypoint'.\nThe regions are shown on the map as blue-ish circles. If the device is within a region, the corresponding circle turns red-ish.  If the description is non-empty and includes a value UUID for an iBeacon, the app starts monitoring the iBeacon region. e.g. 'myBeacons:CA271EAE-5FA8-4E80-8F08-2A302A95A959'\nmonitors any iBeacon identified with UUID = CA..., with major and minor numbers irrelevant.  Everytime the devices enters or leaves a monitored region, an additional location message is published to the MQTT broker.  Use cases:  Define a  home  region to insure that the device publishes a new location when coming home or leaving home even if you do not move more than 500m.  Share your favorite places with your friends (\"Best Sushi in Town\").  Keep a private note (\"Parked Car here\").  Use iBeacons to accurately report enter/leave events for your home\n* Use iBeacons to publish enter/leave events for individual rooms/floors in your home  See also  Waypoints .  Region monitoring (a.k.a. Geo Fences)  If the waypoint description is non-empty and a radius   0 (meters) is set, the\napp starts monitoring the circular region around the specified coordinates. \nRegions are shown on the map as blue-ish circles. If the\ndevice is within a region, the corresponding circle turns red-ish. Every time\nthe devices enters or leaves a monitored region, an additional location message\nis published to the MQTT broker, specifying whether the device is entering or leaving\nsaid region.  For example, you can define a home region to ensure that the device publishes a\nnew location when coming home or leaving home even if you do not move more than\n500m. Share your favorite places with your friends (\"Best Sushi in Town\"). Keep\na private note (\"Parked Car here\").  Region Monitoring with iBeacons  Rather than setting the radius, you may add your iBeacon's UUID and optionally major and minor numbers\nto the description to start region monitoring using iBeacons.  e.g.\n* 'myBeacon:CA271EAE-5FA8-4E80-8F08-2A302A95A959:0001:CAFE'\nreports region with description 'myBeacon' when the iBeacon identified with UUID = CA..., major = 0001 and minor = CAFE is in proximity   'myBeacons:CA271EAE-5FA8-4E80-8F08-2A302A95A959'\nreports region with description 'myBeacons' when any iBeacon identified with UUID = CA..., with major and minor numbers irrelevant is in proximity   Remote configuration  You can help your friends customize their copy of OwnTracks with  remote configuration .  Why do location publishes sometimes seem to cease to work?  Here's what happens:  If the app goes into Background, the connection is disconnected because the app\ncannot maintain the TCP connection in background.  If you bring the app back into foreground, the app will re-connect.  When a location change is recorded (no matter if manual, significant, move or\nregion mode), a message is prepared and an attempt to connect to the broker is\nstarted. If there is an error, connect will be retried after 2, 4, 8, ..., 64,\n64, .... seconds until it succeeds.  BUT...  If the application is in background or is sent to the background, retries are\nrestarted eventually - depending on iOS' background execution model about every 10 minutes.  With automatic modes switched off, even when bringing the app to foreground, no\nnew location updates are generated.  Today Widget / Apple Watch  There is a \"today Widget\" you can enable in OwnTracks for iOS which will show friends and their distances from you.  All friends which have a name are shown on the Today Widget or on the Apple Watch.   A name is assigned either by linking a friend to an address book entry (remember we have two different ways to do that: One modifies the address book, the other one just keeps a pointer to the address book record in OwnTracks).  or by sending a  card .",

This update will be transmitted to the broker when the \nshare\n option is on and will be reflected on your map screen. You may use this to keep track of moveable items as luggage or your car.\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\nAs from version 0.6.4 our Android app also supports beacons using the \naltbeacon\n library. From their issues:\n\n\n\n\nthe issue is that not 100% of beacon transmissions get received by mobile devices. They get lost due to radio noise and/or low signal. This is one of the many reasons that the best practice is to have beacons advertise as many times per second as possible. If no beacons are detected in the sampling interval, you will get exit notifications followed quickly by entry notifications\n\n\nThe phone has a WiFi / Bluetooth interference problem. Some phones like the Moto G, the Moto X and the Nexus 4 don't scan for bluetooth devices properly when WiFi is enabled. This can cause intermittent cases where no detections can be made. If you have one of these devices, disable WiFi.\n\n\n\n\nExample: office\n\n\nUpon arriving at our Frankfurt location, I see from the monitor panel at the reception that Jane is in the office, so I'll pop in to ask a question.\n\n\n\n\nInstead of relying solely on the location your smart phone thinks you are at, small, and relatively inexpensive \niBeacons\n can pinpoint you down to a few meters. OwnTracks for iOS has had support for iBeacons for a few releases now, and it works very reliably.\n\n\nBeacons use Bluetooth low energy to transmit a UUID (typically modifiable) together with user-defined \nmajor\n and \nminor\n numbers, and these allow us to identify, say, a particular room in a building or even a specific corner of a room. The \nmajor\n number can be used, say, to identify an office building, whereas you'd configure a beacon's \nminor\n number to identify a room within that building. Alternatively, if you don't want to bother with identifying rooms, you can e.g. set all beacons to have the same \nmajor\n and \nminor\n numbers.\n\n\nLet's assume the office we're discussing has a few beacons. Let's further assume we do not want to track people within a particular room; instead we just want to capture whether an employee is in this particular office building. We can configure all beacons with the same UUID, and we will ignore the \nmajor\n and \nminor\n numbers. (How a beacon gets it's UUID, \nmajor\n, and \nminor\n set depends on the product.)\n\n\nWe define a UUID, say, \nDEADBEEF-ABBA-CAFE-AFFE-123456789012\n which we assign to all beacons, and configure them accordingly. (The \nBlukii\n iBeacons we use have a utility with which we can configure them accordingly.)\n\n\nWhat we then do is configure a waypoint within the iOS OwnTracks app. The values for latitude/longitude are irrelevant.

From their issues:   the issue is that not 100% of beacon transmissions get received by mobile devices. They get lost due to radio noise and/or low signal. This is one of the many reasons that the best practice is to have beacons advertise as many times per second as possible. If no beacons are detected in the sampling interval, you will get exit notifications followed quickly by entry notifications  The phone has a WiFi / Bluetooth interference problem. Some phones like the Moto G, the Moto X and the Nexus 4 don't scan for bluetooth devices properly when WiFi is enabled. This can cause intermittent cases where no detections can be made.

Instead of relying solely on the location your smart phone thinks you are at, small, and relatively inexpensive  iBeacons  can pinpoint you down to a few meters. OwnTracks for iOS has had support for iBeacons for a few releases now, and it works very reliably.  Beacons use Bluetooth low energy to transmit a UUID (typically modifiable) together with user-defined  major  and  minor  numbers, and these allow us to identify, say, a particular room in a building or even a specific corner of a room. The  major  number can be used, say, to identify an office building, whereas you'd configure a beacon's  minor  number to identify a room within that building. Alternatively, if you don't want to bother with identifying rooms, you can e.g. set all beacons to have the same  major  and  minor  numbers.  Let's assume the office we're discussing has a few beacons. Let's further assume we do not want to track people within a particular room; instead we just want to capture whether an employee is in this particular office building. We can configure all beacons with the same UUID, and we will ignore the  major  and  minor  numbers. (How a beacon gets it's UUID,  major , and  minor  set depends on the product.)  We define a UUID, say,  DEADBEEF-ABBA-CAFE-AFFE-123456789012  which we assign to all beacons, and configure them accordingly. (The  Blukii  iBeacons we use have a utility with which we can configure them accordingly.)  What we then do is configure a waypoint within the iOS OwnTracks app. The values for latitude/longitude are irrelevant. What is important is the UUID separated from the name of the beacon (I chose  Main@WestWing  here) by a colon. A beacon's  major  and  minor  are optionally concatenated to that string, also colon-separated.  Instead of painstakingly configuring this on the device proper, I prepare a small file called  office.otrw  (the  .otrw  extension is important), with the following  JSON  payload:  {\n   waypoints  : [\n    {\n       tst  : 1432817332,\n       lat  : 52.0,\n       _type  :  waypoint ,\n       lon  : 6.0,\n       rad  : 0,\n       desc  :  Main@WestWing:DEADBEEF-ABBA-CAFE-AFFE-123456789012:0001 \n    }\n  ],\n   _type  :  waypoints \n}  I then either place that file on a Web server, or e-mail it as attachment to my colleagues who open that on their OwnTracks device, and presto: the device has the beacon monitoring regions configured.  From this point on, OwnTracks monitors all beacons with that particular UUID, and it will publish an  enter  or  leave  event whenever the device gets within range of a beacon or leaves it. Additionally, the device shows the event with a local iOS notification.   We publish these  events as JSON  via MQTT to the MQTT broker the device is connected to, and from there, you consume the message and do as you please.  {\n     _type :  transition ,\n     acc : 65,\n     desc :  Main@WestWing ,\n     event :  enter ,\n     lat : 2.2222,\n     lon : 1.1111,\n     tid :  jp ,\n     tst : 1433342520,\n     wtst : 1432817332\n}  For instance, send an e-mail when a particular person leaves the building, publish a list of people who remain in the building on a monitor (as above), etc.  To summarize: OwnTracks can monitor beacons by configuring it either with:   a  UUID  only, in which case the app would report any beacon with that UUID, irrespective of its  major / minor  numbers.  a  UUID  with a  major  number: the app would report iBeacons with the specified UUID and exactly that  major  number  all three: the  UUID , the  major  and  minor  numbers, in which case the app reports events on precisely that beacon.",
